## russh

Gitssh is built on top of **russh**, a pure-Rust SSH client and server library.

```
Copyright 2016 Pierre-Étienne Meunier
Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0
```

russh was originally written by **Pierre-Étienne Meunier** as part of the
[Pijul](https://pijul.org/) version-control project and continues to be
maintained at <https://github.com/warp-tech/russh> by Warp Technologies and
the open-source community.

### What Gitssh uses from russh

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `russh` | SSH handshake, key exchange, authentication, exec channel |
| `russh-cryptovec` | Mlock-backed, zeroize-on-drop buffer for key material |
| `russh-keys` | OpenSSH key decoding and agent protocol |

Gitssh uses russh 0.59 from crates.io with the `aws-lc-rs` cryptography backend,
which provides post-quantum cryptography (PQC) support without requiring CMake,
bindgen, or Go for non-FIPS builds.

## aws-lc-rs

The `aws-lc-rs` crate provides cryptographic primitives (AES-GCM,
ChaCha20-Poly1305, SHA-2, HKDF, key generation, and post-quantum algorithms)
used by russh.

aws-lc-rs is a Rust wrapper around AWS-LC, a general-purpose cryptographic
library maintained by AWS that includes FIPS 140-3 validated implementations
and post-quantum cryptography primitives.
